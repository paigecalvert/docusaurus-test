Before you can create your first release with Replicated, make sure that the following requirements are met:

1. Configure the environment variables and install the replicated CLI. See [Installing the replicated CLI](/reference/replicated-cli-installing).
:::note
Exporting the token environment variable is valid for a single session. You must export it for each new session.
:::

1. Create a new application using the `replicated app create APP_NAME` command. You only need to do this procedure once for each application that you want to deploy. See [`app create`](/reference/replicated-cli-app-create) in _Reference_.

1. For the first release of an application, drag and drop your application files into the file directory in the YAML editor.

  If you are editing a draft or an existing non-promoted release, the files appear in the YAML editor. You can drag and drop new manifest files as needed.

  You can also click the plus icon to add a new, untitled YAML file.

1. Edit the YAML files as needed, and click **Save release**. This saves a draft that you can continue to edit until you promote it.

  :::note
  To edit a draft release, click **Edit YAML** from the Releases page.

        <th width="30%">Field</th>
        <th width="70%">Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Channel</td>
        <td>Select the channel where you want to promote the release. The defaults are Stable, Beta, and Unstable. If you created custom channels, they are listed here also.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Version label</td>
        <td><p>Enter a version label.</p><p>If semantic versioning is enabled for the channel, you must use a valid semantic version using the X.Y.Z format, where X is the major version, Y is the minor version, and Z is the patch version. These must be non-negative integers and cannot contain leading zeroes. Each element must increase numerically.</p><p>For more information, see <a href="releases-about#enable-semantic-versioning">Enable Semantic Versioning</a> in <i>About Releases</i> and <a href="https://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a> on the Semantic Versioning website.</p></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Requirements</td>
        <td><p>Select <strong>Prevent this release from being skipped during upgrades</strong> to mark the release as required. When a release is required, the admin console requires users to upgrade to that version before they can upgrade to a later version.</p><p>For example, if you select <strong>Prevent this release from being skipped during upgrades</strong> for release v2.0.0, users with v1.0.0 deployed must upgrade to v2.0.0 before they can upgrade to a version later than v2.0.0, such as v2.1.0.</p><p>Required releases are supported in the app manager v1.68.0 and later.</p><p>After users deploy a required version, they can no longer redeploy (roll back to) versions earlier than the required version, even if <code>allowRollback</code> is <code>true</code> in the Application custom resource manifest.

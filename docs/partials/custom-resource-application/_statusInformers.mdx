```yaml
statusInformers:
    - deployment/my-web-svc
    - deployment/my-worker
```
The following example shows excluding a specific status informer based on a user-supplied value from the admin console Configuration screen:
```yaml
statusInformers:
    - deployment/my-web-svc
    - '{{repl if ConfigOptionEquals "option" "value"}}deployment/my-worker{{repl else}}{{repl end}}'
```

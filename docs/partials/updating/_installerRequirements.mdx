* Replicated recommends that you use the same flags with the installation script that you have used previously. For a complete list of the available installation flags, see [Advanced Options](https://kurl.sh/docs/install-with-kurl/advanced-options) in the kURL documentation.
* If you used the `installer-spec-file` flag to pass a `patch.yaml` file when you ran the installation script previously, you must include the `installer-spec-file flag` with the same `patch.yaml` file when you re-run the installation script. This prevents the specification from the vendor from overwriting any configuration from your `patch.yaml` file and making changes to the add-ons in your cluster.

   **Example**

   ```
   curl https://kurl.sh/latest | sudo bash -s installer-spec-file="./patch.yaml"
   ```

* By default, the KOTS add-on in the Kubernetes installer specification also upgrades your application to the latest version when you run the installation script.

    To avoid automatically upgrading your application version, you must include the `app-version-label` flag, and set the flag to the desired version of the application. For example, to continue using the same application version, set the `app-version-label` flag to the currently installed application version.

    **Example**

    ```
    curl https://kurl.sh/latest | sudo bash -s app-version-label=1.5.0  
    ```

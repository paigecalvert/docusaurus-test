If the script detects that the version of Kubernetes in your cluster must be upgraded, it prints a `Drain local node and apply upgrade?` prompt. Confirm the prompt to drain the local primary node and apply the Kubernetes upgrade to the control plane.

   The script continues to drain and upgrade nodes sequentially. For each node, the script prints a command that you must run on the node to upgrade Kubernetes. 

   After the Kubernetes upgrade on each node is complete, the script automatically updates any add-ons in your cluster.

   For more information about this update process, see [About Updating Kubernetes Installer Clusters](#overview) above.

The VM must meet the following requirements:

  * Ubuntu 18.04
  * At least 8 GB of RAM
  * 4 CPU cores
  * At least 50GB of disk space

  :::note
  If you use a virtual machine that is behind a firewall, make sure that port 8800 (and any other ports you attempt to access through the internet) are allowed to accept traffic. GCP and AWS typically require firewall rule creation to expose ports.

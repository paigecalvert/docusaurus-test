Replicated also offers a sandbox environment where you can complete several beginner, intermediate, and advanced labs. The sandbox environment automatically provisions the required Kubernetes cluster or VM where you will install a sample application as part of the labs.

To get started with an introductory lab, see [Deploy a Hello World Application with Replicated](https://play.instruqt.com/replicated/tracks/hello-world).

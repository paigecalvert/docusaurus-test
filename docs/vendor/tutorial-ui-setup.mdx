# Introduction and Setup

<TutorialIntro/>

The steps in this UI-based tutorial show you how to use the Replicated vendor portal to perform these tasks. The vendor portal is the user interface that you use as a software vendor to create, configure, and manage your application artifacts, including application releases, release channels, customer entitlements, private image registries, and more.

For a tutorial that demonstrates how to use the replicated CLI to create and promote releases for your application, see [CLI Tutorial](tutorial-cli-setup).

## Set Up the Environment

As part of this tutorial, you install a sample application onto an existing Kubernetes cluster, or onto a cluster provisioned by the Replicated Kubernetes installer. The Kubernetes installer creates the cluster on an existing virtual machine (VM).

Before you begin this tutorial, ensure that you have one of the following environments set up:

- A Kubernetes cluster that you can access with the kubectl command-line tool. Your cluster must meet the minimum system requirements described in [Existing Cluster Requirements](/enterprise/installing-general-requirements#existing-cluster-requirements) in _Installation Requirements_.

   You can use any cloud provider or tool that you prefer to create a cluster, such as Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Amazon Web Services (AWS), or minikube. 

   **Example:**

    For example, to create a cluster in GKE, run the following command in the gcloud CLI:

    ```
    gcloud container clusters create NAME --preemptible --no-enable-ip-alias
    ```
    Replace `NAME` with any name you want to use for the cluster.

    For information about installing and configuring the kubectl command-line tool, see [Install Tools](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/) and [Command line tool (kubectl)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/) in the Kubernetes documentation.


- A VM where the Kubernetes installer can create a cluster. The Kubernetes installer script installs and configures the kubectl command-line tool for you.

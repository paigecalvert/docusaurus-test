# Step 9: Update the Application

To test the new release that you promoted, return to the Replicated admin console in a browser to update the application.

To update the application:

1. Access the admin console using `https://localhost:8800` if the installation script is still running. Otherwise, run the following command to access the admin console:

  ```bash
  kubectl kots admin-console --namespace NAMESPACE
  ```

  Replace `NAMESPACE` with the namespace where the app manager is installed.

1. Go to the Version history page, and click **Check for update**.

   The admin console loads the new release that you promoted.

1. Click **Deploy**. In the dialog, click **Yes, deploy** to deploy the new version.

1. After the admin console deploys the new version, go to the **Config** page where the **Another Text Example** field that you added is displayed.

1. In the new **Another Text Example** field, enter any text. Click **Save config**.

   The admin console notifies you that the configuration settings for the application have changed.

1. In the dialog, click **Go to updated version**.

   The admin console loads the updated version on the Version history page.

1. On the Version history page, click **Deploy** next to the latest version to deploy the configuration change.

1. After the admin console deploys the configuration change, go to the **Dashboard** page and click **Open App**. The application displays the text that you added to the field.

   If you do not see the new text, refresh your browser.

## Next Steps

Congratulations! As part of this tutorial, you:
* Created and promoted a release for a Kubernetes application using the replicated CLI
* Installed the application in a Kubernetes cluster
* Edited the manifest files for the application, adding a new configuration field and using template functions to reference the field
* Promoted a new release with your changes
* Used the admin console to update the application to the latest version

As a next step, you can continue to iterate on your application, using `replicated release create --auto` to promote each new release. For ideas on features and functionality to add to your sample application, see [Adding Functionality to Your Releases](/vendor/distributing-workflow#adding-functionality-to-your-releases) in _How to Package and Distribute a Production Application_.

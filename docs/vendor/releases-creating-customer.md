# Creating a Customer

After you promote a release to a channel, you create a customer.

Each customer that you create in the Replicated vendor portal has a unique license file. Each customer license uniquely identifies the customer and the application, specifies their release channel, and defines entitlement information about the customer.

For more information about customer licenses, see [About Customer Licenses](licenses-about).

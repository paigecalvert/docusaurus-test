# Creating Releases with Standard Manifest Files

This topic describes how to use the Replicated vendor portal or the replicated CLI to create and promote versions of your application using standard manifest files.

### Create and Promote a Release

This procedure shows how to create a new release using local application files and the replicated CLI.

To create and promote a new release:

1. Make sure that you have a local folder with your application files.

1. Lint the manifest files and ensure that there are no errors in the YAML:

  ```bash
  replicated release lint --yaml-dir=PATH_TO_APP_DIR
  ```

  Replace `PATH_TO_APP_DIR` with path to the directory of the YAML manifest files.

  For more information about linting, see [release lint](replicated-cli-release-lint) and [Linter Rules](linter) in _Reference_.

1. Create a new release:

    ```bash
    replicated release create --yaml-dir PATH_TO_APP_DIR
    ```
    Replace `PATH_TO_APP_DIR` with the path to the directory of the YAML manifest files.

   For more information, see [release create](/reference/replicated-cli-release-create) or [release update](../reference/replicated-cli-release-update) in _Reference_.

1. Continue to edit and lint the release as needed, then update the release:

    ```
    replicated release update SEQUENCE --yaml-dir PATH-TO-APP-DIRECTORY
    ```
    Replace:
      
    -  `SEQUENCE` with the release sequence number. This identifies the existing release to be updated.
    -  `PATH_TO_APP_DIR` with the path to the directory of the YAML manifest files.

    For more information, see [release update](../reference/replicated-cli-release-update) in _Reference_.

1. Promote the release when you are ready to test it. Releases cannot be edited after they are promoted. To make changes after promotion, you have to create a new release.

    ```
    replicated release promote SEQUENCE CHANNEL_ID
    ```

    Replace:
      
    -  `SEQUENCE` with the release sequence number.
    -  `CHANNEL_ID` with the channel ID or case sensitive name of the channel.

    For more information, see [release promote](/reference/replicated-cli-release-promote) in the replicated CLI documentation.

1. Verify that the release was promoted to the channel:

  ```
  replicated release ls
  ```
  
## Next Steps

The following are the recommended next steps to test the application in your development environment:

- To add a customer, see [Creating a Customer](creating-a-customer).
- If you are installing for the first time, see [Overview of Installing an Application with the App Manager](/enterprise/installing-overview) in the _Enterprise_ section. 
- If you are updating an existing installation, see [Updating an Application](../enterprise/updating-apps) in the _Enterprise_ section.

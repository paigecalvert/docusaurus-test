# Step 1: Install the replicated CLI

In this tutorial, you use the replicated CLI to create and promote releases for a sample application with Replicated. The replicated CLI is the CLI for the Replicated vendor portal. For a tutorial that uses the Replicated vendor portal UI to create and promote releases, see [UI Tutorial](tutorial-ui-setup).

This procedure describes how to create a vendor portal account, install the replicated CLI on your local machine, and set up a `REPLICATED_API_TOKEN` environment variable for authentication.

To install the replicated CLI:

1. Do one of the following to create an account in the Replicated vendor portal:
   * **Join an existing team**: If you have an existing vendor portal team, you can ask your team administrator to send you an invitation to join.
   * **Start a trial**: Alternatively, go to [vendor.replicated.com](https://vendor.replicated.com/) and click **Sign up** to create a 21-day trial account for completing this tutorial.

1. Run the following command to use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) to install the CLI:

  ```
  brew install replicatedhq/replicated/cli
  ```

  For the latest Linux or macOS versions of the replicated CLI, see the [replicatedhq/replicated](https://github.com/replicatedhq/replicated/releases) releases in GitHub.

1. Verify the installation:

  ```
  replicated version
  ```
  **Example output**:

  ```json
  {
      "version": "0.37.2",
      "git": "8664ac3",
      "buildTime": "2021-08-24T17:05:26Z",
      "go": {
          "version": "go1.14.15",
          "compiler": "gc",
          "os": "darwin",
          "arch": "amd64"
      }
  }
  ```
  If you run a replicated CLI command, such as `replicated release ls`, you see the following error message about a missing API token:

  ```
  Error: set up APIs: Please provide your API token
  ```

1. Create an API token for the replicated CLI:

   1. Log in to the vendor portal, and go to the [Account settings](https://vendor.replicated.com/account-settings) page.

   1. Under User API Tokens, click **New User API Token**. For Nickname, provide a name for the token. For Permissions, select **Read and Write**.

      For more information about User API tokens, see [User Tokens](/reference/replicated-cli-tokens#user-tokens) in _Using Vendor API Tokens_.

   1. Click **Create Token**.

   1. Copy the string that appears in the dialog.

1. Export the string that you copied in the previous step to an environment variable named `REPLICATED_API_TOKEN`:

   ```
   export REPLICATED_API_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN
   ```
   Replace `YOUR_TOKEN` with the token string that you copied from the vendor portal in the previous step.

1. Verify the User API token:

   ```
   replicated release ls
   ```

   You see the following error message:

   ```
   Error: App not found:
   ```
